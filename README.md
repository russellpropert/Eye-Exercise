# Eye Excercise

## Description
This exercise displays a set of eyes that follow the movement of your mouse. The project was built with CSS and JavaScript.

## How To Run
This exercise can be run by forking the repository (button in upper left), cloning it to your machine, and dragging the index.html file into your browser window. The exercise can also be run fromÂ [here](https://russellpropert.github.io/MIT-MERN/08week/Eye_Movement_Assignment/index.html).

## Future Improvements
I may add an object that follows the mouse clicks of the user, so the eyes follow the object instead of the mouse pointer.
